- Combat Squad is an online multiplayer FPS where you can choose your nickname, create your own room and play with your friends.

# Where can I play?

- [HERE!](https://devkiloton.itch.io/combat-squad)

# Why? 

- I was wanting to develop an online multiplayer game and this project is the result.

- Also, you can use this project as you wish, be for study or commercial use. Just be careful with the assets, the sounds and their royalties!

# How does it really works?

- First of all, you are connected to network.

- Once connected and inside the lobby, you define your nickname.

- You can choose if you will create a new room or if you will find one.

- If you want to create a room, you just need to give a name for this room and start the game.

- Also, if you were invited by your friends to play a match, you can click at "FIND ROOM" and search for your friends room and then, join into the match.

# Final considerations

- It was a quite exhaustive project, sometimes hard because of the difficulty of
  how to implement the multiplayer mechanics, but in general it was cool, but in the
  future I want to do better.
